# Reliable UDP File Transfer

This project implements reliable file transfer over UDP using custom acknowledgment and retransmission mechanisms.

Originally developed as part of a collaborative project.  
**This repository highlights my individual contributions**, including:
- Development of the **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for user interaction (file selection, progress display, status reporting).
- Implementation of the **Proxy** to simulate packet loss, corruption, and manage retransmissions between sender and receiver.

## 🚀 Features
- Reliable file transfer over UDP
- Proxy-based packet loss and corruption simulation
- GUI for easier file selection and transfer monitoring
- Retransmission and checksum validation mechanisms

## 🛠️ Built With
- C++ (Socket Programming)
- Qt (for GUI)

## 📜 Notes
- This repository contains only my contributions extracted from the original group project.
- Other components (e.g., Sender/Receiver basic structure) were developed collaboratively.
