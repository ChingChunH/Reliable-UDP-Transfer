# 🚀 Reliable UDP File Transfer

This project implements reliable file transfer over UDP using custom acknowledgment and retransmission mechanisms.

Originally developed as part of a collaborative project.  
This repository contains the complete project code, with **my individual contributions focused on**:
- 🖥️ Development of the **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for user interaction (file selection, progress display, status reporting).
- 🔀 Implementation of the **Proxy** to simulate packet loss, corruption, and manage retransmissions between sender and receiver.
